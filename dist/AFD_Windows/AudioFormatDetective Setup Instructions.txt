AudioFormatDetective Installation Guide


In the Windows search bar start typing "Powershell", when that appears at the top, 
right click on it and "run as administrator"


Copy this EXACT line and paste it into the Powershell terminal and hit ENTER:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))



You may be prompted to install .Net Framework, this is fine, all goodness. 

Once that's finished, copy and paste this EXACT line into the powershell terminal and hit ENTER:

choco install ffmpeg


Then put AudioFormatDetective.exe on your Desktop and double click.
You'll be asked to drag your AJ downloads folder onto the open terminal window, 
this is so the app can know which folder to watch. 

If all goes well you'll see "Monitoring folder....<your folder>


After that you need to download a zip file into that folder, the app will unzip the archive, delete the zip, then evaluate the files.
This version will only run again if there's a zip file in that folder. 

Good luck!
